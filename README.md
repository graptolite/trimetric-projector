Each face of the cuboid net (see Figure 1 of `derivation/derivation.pdf`) must go up to the page margins exactly (i.e., no rounded corners from boundary/edge paths, which should be put on afterwards). The SVG files must be named `x.svg`, `y.svg` and `z.svg` where the axis label (e.g., `x`) is the axis that the face is normal to.

Tested for SVG files created and saved by Inkscape.
